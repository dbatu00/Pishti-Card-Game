# Pishti-Card-Game
Standard 52 pack card game with simple bot

Pişti is a card game played with a single deck of 52 cards. The game can be played with 2 or 4 players, but in this project, it will be played with 2 players.

In Pişti, two cards with the same numeric value are considered identical. For example, a ten of hearts is the same as a ten of diamonds, or a jack of clubs is the same as a jack of spades.

Gameplay:
- At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 4 cards. Additionally, 3 face-down cards and 1 face-up card are placed on the table.
- Players take turns playing one of their cards onto the face-up card on the table.
- If a player has a card with the same numeric value as the face-up card, they can play it to capture all the cards on the table.
- In addition, the jack (J) is a special card that can capture all the cards on the table regardless of their numeric values.
- If there is only one card on the table and you play a card with the same value, you make a "pişti," which allows you to capture the 2 cards on the table, and the game continues with the next card to be played by the other player.
- When both players run out of cards in their hands, 4 cards are dealt to each player again. The game ends when there are no more cards left in the deck.

Scoring at the end of the game is as follows:

Pişti: 10 points

Points for cards captured from the table:
- Ace: 1 point
- 2 of Spades: 2 points
- 10 of Diamonds: 3 points
- Jack: 1 point
- Card Count: If you have more cards than your opponent, you earn 3 points.

The player with the highest score wins the game.

Players:
In this game, there will be 2 players, one human and one bot. The bot can play a random card in each turn, but it is preferable for it to follow the rules and make the most logical move.
